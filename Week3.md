Task 1:
Whistleblowers play an important role in identifying and calling out misconduct and harm to consumers and the community. To encourage whistleblowers to come forward with their concerns and protect them when they do, the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act) gives certain people legal rights and protections as whistleblowers.
Read the following situations and discuss if it is required to blow the whistle:
•	A member in a data science team has noticed that several data science team did not take the proper measures to anonymize the identity of the users before building the data science tools.

If a data science team does not take appropriate steps to anonymize user data, this can lead to privacy breaches and misuse of sensitive information. Whistleblowing would likely be justified here, as it involves potential harm to users and the public’s trust. This could also expose the company to regulatory penalties. Reporting this issue internally first is ideal, but if ignored, external whistleblowing may be necessary.

•	A data science team has agreed with a client to perform a project. The team received the funding from that client, and started funding other projects that the team already has, without notifying the client.

Using client-provided funds for projects other than the agreed scope, without the client’s consent, constitutes financial misconduct. In this case, whistleblowing is warranted because such an action could damage the client relationship and may have broader legal consequences for the organization. Reporting this behavior would protect the integrity of both the company and client partnerships.

•	In a meeting with a client, one data scientist noticed that not all information was given to the client. He also noticed that the client was given unrealistic deadlines to finish the project.

Providing incomplete information and unrealistic deadlines can harm the client and damage their trust in the organization. While this may not immediately seem as severe as the previous examples, it is still unethical and could be detrimental if the project fails to meet expectations. It may be best to raise concerns internally first to clarify if there were misunderstandings. If the team knowingly misleads the client, however, whistleblowing might be necessary to prevent further escalation of the issue.

To conclude, all three scenarios involve ethical concerns, but the first two involve clear violations that impact users’ privacy and client trust directly, making whistleblowing more immediately justified. The third scenario could first benefit from internal clarification before considering whistleblowing.

Task 2: 

Jordan, a data analyst at ABC Solutions, faces an ethical dilemma: sharing insights from a client’s sensitive data from with a friend, Taylor from a competitor company. According to the ACS Code of Ethics, 

1. **Public Interest**: Protecting customer privacy is paramount. Jordan should not share insights, even non-specific, with Taylor to avoid breaching public trust.

2. **Honesty**: Disclosing any part of XYZMart's data would be deceptive and compromise professional integrity. Jordan should communicate firmly with Taylor about the ethical boundaries.

3. **Confidentiality**: Sharing proprietary insights violates XYZMart's confidentiality and could impact their competitive edge. Jordan must keep data secure.

4. **Professionalism**: Engaging in actions for personal gain that could harm ABC Solutions' reputation is unprofessional. If pressured, Jordan should seek guidance from a supervisor.

In summary, Jordan should refrain from sharing any data with Taylor, uphold confidentiality, and prioritize ethical standards in line with the ACS Code.
To resolve the dilemma, Jordan should decline to share insights, maintain confidentiality, and, if needed, report the situation to a supervisor to ensure responsible conduct.
