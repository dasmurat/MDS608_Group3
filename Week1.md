web development is less important compared to others as it does not require coding skill as much as others.


•	A data scientist trying to switch to machine learning engineer by learning how to code in pytorch. (High)
This one is high because the most important thing for career development is practical test. Also pytorch is one of the most useful tools in the field.

•	A data scientist applying for a master’s in finance.  (Medium)
